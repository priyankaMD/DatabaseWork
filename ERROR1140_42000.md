## Error code is : 
  ERROR 1140 (42000)
## Error content: 
  " In aggregated query without GROUP BY,expression #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column           'usb.catissue_participant.VITAL_STATUS';this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by "
  
This error is normally faced when we create a query with 'GROUP BY' clause. It simply means,the aggregated columns need to be grouped by the non aggregated columns.

Suppose I write a query for count of participant per vital status (Vital status are 'Alive' or 'Dead'). Query is,

  SELECT vital_status,count(*) 
  FROM catissue_participant 
  WHERE ACTIVITY_STATUS != "Disabled"
  GROUP BY vital_status;
  
 If I executed above query, it give correct result it displays participant count
